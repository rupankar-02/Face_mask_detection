Face Mask Detection Project

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to automatically detect whether individuals in an image are wearing a face mask. The need for automated mask detection has become crucial during global health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, where monitoring public spaces for mask compliance can reduce the risk of virus transmission.

Workflow:
Dataset Acquisition: The model is trained on the Face Mask Dataset from Kaggle, containing images categorized into "with mask" and "without mask."

Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented (e.g., flipping, rotation) to improve the model's performance and generalization to diverse scenarios.

Model Architecture: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized for image classification. Pre-trained models like MobileNetV2 or ResNet50 can be fine-tuned for the binary classification task of mask detection. These models are chosen for their high efficiency and accuracy in image-based tasks.

Evaluation: The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix to assess its performance on the validation set. This ensures that the model can generalize well and accurately detect masks in various environments.

Deployment: After training, the model can be deployed using a web framework like Flask or Streamlit. Users can upload images through a web interface, where the system will automatically detect mask usage. The model can also be integrated into surveillance systems, such as CCTV, to monitor mask compliance in real-time.

Future Scope:
The project can be expanded to detect not only mask presence but also mask quality and proper usage. It can be integrated into public spaces like airports, malls, and hospitals to enhance safety.
